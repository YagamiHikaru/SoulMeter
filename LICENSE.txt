                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

NPCAP COPYRIGHT / END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

Npcap is a Windows packet sniffing driver and library and is copyright
(c) 2013-2020 by Insecure.Com LLC ("The Nmap Project").  All rights
reserved.

Even though Npcap source code is publicly available for review, it is
not open source software and may not be redistributed without special
permission from the Nmap Project.  The standard version is also
limited to installation on five systems. We fund the Npcap project by
selling two types of commercial licenses to a special Npcap OEM
edition:

1) Npcap OEM Redistribution License allows companies to redistribute
Npcap with their products.

2) Npcap OEM Internal Use License allows companies to use Npcap OEM
internally in excess of the free/demo version's normal 5-system
limitation.

Both of these licenses include updates and support as well as a
warranty.  Npcap OEM also includes a silent installer for unattended
installation.  Further details about Npcap OEM are available from
https://nmap.org/npcap/oem/, and you are also welcome to contact us at
sales@nmap.com to ask any questions or set up a license for your
organization.

Free and open source software producers are also welcome to contact us
for redistribution requests.  However, we normally recommend that such
authors instead ask your users to download and install Npcap themselves.

If the Nmap Project (directly or through one of our commercial
licensing customers) has granted you additional rights to Npcap or
Npcap OEM, those additional rights take precedence where they conflict
with the terms of this license agreement.

Since the Npcap source code is available for download and review,
users sometimes contribute code patches to fix bugs or add new
features.  By sending these changes to the Nmap Project (including
through direct email or our mailing lists or submitting pull requests
through our source code repository), it is understood unless you
specify otherwise that you are offering the Nmap Project the
unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicence your
code contribution so that we may (but are not obligated to)
incorporate it into Npcap.  If you wish to specify special license
conditions or restrictions on your contributions, just say so when you
send them.

This copy of Npcap (the "Software") and accompanying documentation is
licensed and not sold. This Software is protected by copyright laws
and treaties, as well as laws and treaties related to other forms of
intellectual property. The Nmap Project owns intellectual property
rights in the Software.  The Licensee's ("you" or "your") license to
download, use, copy, or change the Software is subject to these rights
and to all the terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement
("Agreement").

ACCEPTANCE

By accepting this agreement or by downloading, installing, using, or
copying the Software, or by clicking "I Agree", you agree to be bound
by the terms of this EULA.  If you do not agree to the terms of this
EULA, do not install, use, or copy the Software.

LICENSE GRANT

This Agreement entitles you to install and use five (5) copies of the
Software. In addition, you may make archival copies of the Software
which may only be used for the reinstallation of the Software. This
Agreement does not permit the installation or use of more than 5
copies of the Software, or the installation of the Software on more
than five computer at any given time, on a system that allows shared
used of applications by more than five users, or on any configuration
or system of computers that allows more than five users. A user may
only have one instance of this Agreement active at once.  For example,
downloading the software multiple times, downloading multiple versions
of the software, and/or executing the software installer multiple
times do not grant any additional rights such as using the software on
more machines.

The terms "computer" and "machine" in this license include any
computing device, including software computing instances such as
virtual machines and Docker containers.

Copies of Npcap do not count toward the five copy, five computer, or
five user limitations imposed by this section if they are installed
and used solely in conjunction with any of the following software:

o The Nmap Security Scanner, as distributed from https://nmap.org

o The Wireshark network protocol analyzer, as distributed from
  https://www.wireshark.org/
  
o Microsoft Defender for Identity, as distributed from
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/identity-defender

Users wishing to redistribute Npcap or exceed the usage limits imposed
by this free license or benefit from commercial support and features
such as a silent installer should contact sales@nmap.com to obtain an
appropriate commercial license agreement.  More details on our OEM
edition is also available from https://nmap.org/npcap/oem/.

THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE ATTRIBUTION

Npcap uses several 3rd party open source software libraries:

* The libpcap portable packet capturing library from https://tcpdump.org
* The Winpcap packet capturing library. It has been abandoned, but is
  currently still available from https://www.winpcap.org/.
* The ieee80211_radiotap.h header file from David Young

All of these are open source with BSD-style licenses that allow for
unlimited use and royalty-free redistribution within other software
(including commercial/proprietary software). Some include a warranty
disclaimer (relating to the original authors) and require a small
amount of acknowledgment text be added somewhere in the documentation
of any software which includes them (including indirect inclusion
through Npcap).

The required acknowledgement text as well as full license text and
source details for these libraries is available from:
https://npcap.org/src/docs/Npcap-Third-Party-Open-Source.pdf .

Since Insecure.Com LLC is not the author of this 3rd party code, we
can not waive or modify it’s software copyright or license.  Npcap
users and redistributors must comply with the relevant Npcap license
(either the free/demo license or a commercial Npcap OEM license they
may have purchased) as well as the minimal requirements of this 3rd
party open source software.
